## 🎓 **CONCLUSION**

The current system has excellent coverage of core features but is missing:

**Critical for Operations:**
- Vehicle management (can't run practical lessons efficiently)
- Certificate generation (legal requirement)

**Critical for Revenue:**
- Payment gateway integration (currently just tracking)
- SMS notifications (reduces no-shows = more revenue)

**Important for Growth:**
- Multi-location support
- Advanced reporting
- Marketing tools

**Nice to Have:**

The system is production-ready for basic driving school operations but would benefit significantly from Phase 1 and 2 implementations for a complete commercial solution.
